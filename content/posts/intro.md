I got a 5 word domain name in 2019!

[Kakku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakku) has a meaning also.

> Kakku (火9) is a Japanese abbreviation for Kayō Ku-ji (火曜9時), meaning Tuesday at 9PM

What makes this domain special for me is that "kaku" is my nickname.

In past, I have tried to blog on different platforms under various domain names. Finally I have purchased this domain kakku.org and created this blog on hugo platform. I intend to keep this domain and this blog going forward.

During my university, I blogged on https://mypynotes.wordpress.com/ but I was not active there anymore. Nowadays, I am spending a lot of time learning and improving, having a blog will help me to keep posting about it for my and anyone else's future reference. Learning something and blogging about will require me to go deeper into the subject. Blogging has many other [benefits](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf/) also.
